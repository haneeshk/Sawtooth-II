\caption{(\textsf{A}) Dimensionless force-displacement responses for 38 \EA spicules tested in the simply-supported setup. This data includes the 33 \EA spicules previously tested in~\cite{monn2017enhanced}. The force and displacement are nondimensionalized by the span, $L$, and the slope of the initial linear portion of the $F$-$w_0$ response, $k_s$. The black stars indicate the force and displacement just before the onset of failure or damage. Before failure there is a region of the force-displacement response that displays the sawtooth pattern.
(\textsf{B}) Dimensionless force-displacement responses for 12 \EA spicules tested in the fixed-fixed setup. The force and displacement are nondimensionalized by the span, $L$, and the slope of the initial linear portion of the $F$-$w_0$ response, $k_s$. The black stars indicate the force and displacement just before the onset of failure or damage.
